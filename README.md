# **OPEN MALARIA**
QSAR ML model from Open-Malaria data 

## Getting started
Taking profit of a competition from the [Open Source Malaria project](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/OSM_To_Do_List/issues/421), which provides a collection of molecules and their activity against the malaria parasite's ion pump, PfATP4, a machine learning-based QSAR model was developed. This model aims to predict which molecules will block this target by screening Drugbank and propietary marine molecules libraries.

### System
All analyses were perfomed in **Mac mini6,2 (i7, 16GB RAM)**
